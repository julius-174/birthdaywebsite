      Hey. So, I was wondering how to end this. I had ideas ranging from making a game for you which was basically an endless ocean boat simulator with crazy good graphics and stuff, or an entire virtual library or something, but they all just didnt seem to fit uk. totally not because i didnt want to put in so much effort aha. But yeah, I was wondering. And then I thought about how its kind of become an unofficial unspoken custom of ours to send each other a nais little message to each other for our birthday. And we both know im way too dramatic to not do something big aha💅💅💅. But anyway. I hope you know I dont just not expect you to do something like this, I dont want you to. Whats that line that goes about how a guy who writes a poem for you loves you, a guy who writes a 100 poems for you loves writing poems. Well, I love doing things for you. Even if i dont do them nearly enough. You are, without a doubt, one of the people i love the most. You've been there for me when i neither asked for it, nor did i deserve it. I dont care what happens to you, whether you become an absolute loser or what, I'll always be there for you, no matter what. You can lose everyone you've ever known, but you cant lose me. You can develop amnesia and I'll just harass you and remind you everyday about how you actually owe me 20 nudes. You straight up arent getting rid of me ok. Lowkey a threat ngl. But yes. I suppose there really isnt much i can say that i havent told you already. Even though you're lowkey one of the worst persons to me in the entire entire world i still love u oki. And i dont care if you know it already, I'm gonna keep reminding you that you can always come to me, for anything at all, and I'll be here for you, no matter how badly you fucked something up. But anyway. I've been working on this for quite a while. You might remember back when I'd say i'm working on a project, this was it. And that thing i kept accidentally deleting? That damn animation. But I liked making this. I still feel I dont appreciate you nearly as much as I do even though you do nothing except ignore me and torment me and dont set me up with anyone even though im so nice and keep asking you to and am such a green flag and such a nice person and any girl would be lucky to have me.      
      <p>
        Pls dont expect me to keep one-upping myself for ur birthday every year btw💀💀. I have no idea how i even had the time to do all this tbh. But yes, it was worth it. assuming its all working and operational ofc. I say assuming because i didnt go through the website. You know how i value meaningless sentimental value a lot right? I made the website, yes. and i checked individual parts, but i never went through the entire website from start to end. I wanted you to be the first person to do that in the whole world, even before me. I better get extra points for that btw.
      </p>

        Its been a while since we met. Itll probably be a while before we do meet tbh. I miss you, it was fun to hang out with you back in delhi. You were my favourite person back then too. I know I've said this before, but I really am grateful for you. Even though i may be a little bitch sometimes who lashes out and is mean and lowkey abusive but we'll call it even because you are literally evil and dont get me a girlfriend despite being in a literal girl's college like what the fuck i cant believe you call me your bestie and arent setting me up with a girl when youre LITERALLY at a girls college wtf? But anyway. Happy birthday girle. I cant believe youre 20 man you're so fucking old my god. 20💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀. jesus. milf lowkey? ANYWAY. Thank you for everything. I'm truly, truly grateful you're in my life. And i truly, truly hope you always will be. And even if you dont i'll lowkey just force you to ngl.
      </p>
      <p>
        But yes. I hope you liked this. Totally didnt make it just to show ur friends what an amazing person i am🥰🥰🥰🥰. But anyway. I hope you did like it. I care for you very deeply oki. And I do love you oki. Even if you dont set me up with a girl. tho u totally should aha😊😊😊😊😊. Have a happy birthday Amrita. Take care :)
